# This is a thin wrapper which will call the real configure script, and
# make sure that is called using bash.

# Get an absolute path to this script, since that determines the top-level directory.
this_script_dir=`dirname $0`
this_script_dir=`cd $this_script_dir > /dev/null && pwd`

# Delegate to wrapper, forcing wrapper to believe $0 is this script by using -c.
# This trick is needed to get autoconf to co-operate properly.
# configure文件只是一个wrapper文件. 实际是会直接调用: $this_script_dir/common/autoconf/configure 脚本.
# 进入工程目录的configure脚本,可以看到这个只是一个简单的包装,主要是确定了该脚本的绝对地址,实际调用的是common/autoconf/configure文件
